And   that's   where   machine   learning   comes   in .   Let's   see   how ,   in   the   same   example   for   song   B ,   if   you   draw   a   circle   around   the   song   B ,   we   see   that   there   are   four   words   for   like ,   whereas   one   word   for   dislike .   If   we   go   for   the   majority   words ,   we   can   say   that   Paul   will   definitely   like   the   song .   That's   all .   This   was   a   basic   machine   learning   algorithm .   Also   it's   called   est   Neighbors .   So   this   is   just   a   small   example   in   one   of   the   many   machine   learning   algorithms ,   quite   easy ,   right ?   Believe   me ,   it   is .   But   what   happens   when   the   choices   become   complicated ,   as   in   the   case   of   song   B ,   that's   when   machine   learning   comes   in .   It   learns   the   data ,   builds   the   prediction   model ,   and   when   the   new   data   point   comes   in ,   it   can   easily   predict   for   it   more   the   data   better ,   the   model   higher   will   be   the   accuracy .   There   are   many   ways   in   which   the   machine   learns .   It   could   be   either   supervised   learning ,   unsupervised   learning ,   or   reinforcement   learning .   Let's   first   quickly   understand   supervised   learning .

Summary:
machine learning is one of the many ways in which it works . it can be either supervised learning , unsupervised learning , or reinforcement learning .
